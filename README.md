# open-mother
## ⚠️⚠️ THIS PROJECT IS IN HEAVY WIP ⚠️⚠️
## About
open-mother is a libre open source engine that tries to mimic the Mother series' gameplay.
The engine will be coded in C++ using SDL for the graphics engine (to be decided).

## How would one make a mod on this?
The modding proccess will be very similar to Goldsource modding, the base engine remains untouched whereas the mods (custom maps, stories, items, etc.) will be inside a mod folder containin all the assets and perhaps a .dll/.so file for the code

## Feature list
This is a list of features to be expected to be added inside this engine:
- Simple player
- NPCs
- Enemies
- Dialogue system
- Inventory system
- Battle system
